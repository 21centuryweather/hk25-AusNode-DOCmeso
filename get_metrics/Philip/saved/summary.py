== Intro ==
Convective regions are identified based on the precipitation rate exceeding a threshold
    Method
    -- pr_percentiles --
    With the assumption that energetically, 5% of the domain is on average convered by convection, we calculate
    the 95 percentile precipitation rate in the tropics (30S, 30N) on 3 hourly precipitation, following Boney et al. 2020.
    We also calculate metrics based on the 97th and 99th percentile precipitation rate.

    Results
    These percentiles are equivalent to;
    pr95 = 13.17 mm / day

== DOC_meso ==
Degree of Organization of convection is defined in two categories;
object based and core based
    Method
    -- object based metric --
    object based metrics can broadly described by:
        the mean area of contiguous convective regions
        area fraction of convection

    -- core based metrics --
